  <p>Glazed donuts. Everybody loves &apos;em. Even when seemingly everyone is paleo this and gluten-free that, you
    rarely see someone refuse a glazed donut. Especially when they&apos;re homemade, hot from the oil, and taste just
    like the old-fashioned kind you remember from childhood. This particular recipe turns out donuts that aren&apos;t
    quite as airy as Krispy Kreme donuts, but we don&apos;t think that&apos;s a bad thing. The donuts are less sweet
    than most, which means you can drown them in glaze and they still won&apos;t seem cloying. Talk about our kinda
    donut. Seriously. I can&apos;t stop eating these donuts. This note may have been typed impatiently and one-handedly
    while attempting to lick drippy donut glaze from fingers and wrist before it plummets to certain disaster onto my
    laptop.</p>

      <li>In a medium bowl, dissolve 2 tablespoons yeast in 3/4 cup warm milk. Stir in 3/4 cup of the flour to create a smooth paste. Cover and let rest in a warm spot for 30 minutes.</li> 
      <li>Combine the remaining warm milk and yeast in the bowl. Add the flour mixture along with the sugar, salt, vanilla, and egg yolks. Mix until smooth. Turn off the mixer and add 1/2 cup of the remaining flour. Mix on low for about 30 seconds. Add the butter and mix until it becomes incorporated, about 30 seconds. Add more flour, about 1/4 cup at a time. Knead until the dough pulls completely away from the sides of the bowl and is smooth and not too sticky. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours.</li>
      <li>Line a baking sheet with a lightly floured dish towel. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to 1/2 inch thick. With a donut or cookie cutter, cut out 3-inch-diameter rounds with 1-inch-diameter holes. You can re-roll the scraps and cut out additional holes.</li> 
      <li>Place the donuts at least 1 inch apart on the baking sheet and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rest in a warm spot to proof until they almost double in size, 5 to 20 minutes, peeking every five minutes. To test whether the dough is ready, touch it lightly with a fingertip. If it springs back immediately, it needs more time. If it springs back slowly, it is ready.</li> 
      <li>While the donuts are proofing, heat a heavy-bottomed pot with at least 2 inches of oil until a deep-fat thermometer registers 360˚F (182°C). With a metal spatula, carefully place a couple of doughnut holes or doughnuts in the oil, being careful not to crowd the pot. Fry for 1 to 2 minutes per side, until light golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon, drain on a wire rack over a paper towel, and let cool slightly before glazing. Repeat with the remaining doughnuts and holes, keeping the temperature consistent.</li>
